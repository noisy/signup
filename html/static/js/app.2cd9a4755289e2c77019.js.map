instance.\\n\\n## Supported curves\\n\\nElliptic.js support following curve types:\\n\\n* Short Weierstrass\\n* Montgomery\\n* Edwards\\n* Twisted Edwards\\n\\nFollowing curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:\\n\\n* `secp256k1`\\n* `p192`\\n* `p224`\\n* `p256`\\n* `p384`\\n* `p521`\\n* `curve25519`\\n* `ed25519`\\n\\nNOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.\\n\\n### Implementation details\\n\\nECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of\\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\\n\\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\\n\\n### Related projects\\n\\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\\n  node)\\n\\n#### LICENSE\\n\\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\\n\\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\\\"Software\\\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\\nfollowing conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

instance.\\n\\n## Supported curves\\n\\nElliptic.js support following curve types:\\n\\n* Short Weierstrass\\n* Montgomery\\n* Edwards\\n* Twisted Edwards\\n\\nFollowing curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:\\n\\n* `secp256k1`\\n* `p192`\\n* `p224`\\n* `p256`\\n* `p384`\\n* `p521`\\n* `curve25519`\\n* `ed25519`\\n\\nNOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.\\n\\n### Implementation details\\n\\nECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of\\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\\n\\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\\n\\n### Related projects\\n\\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\\n  node)\\n\\n#### LICENSE\\n\\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\\n\\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\\\"Software\\\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\\nfollowing conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
